<p>fast-panopto is a small Chrome extension I wrote to enable users to select custom video player speeds for cases where they want to quickly go over a lecture or when the lecturer speaks slowly.
I only ever intended to use it personally but it ended up being more popular than I ever imagined with 2,500 weekly users at the time of writing this.</p>

<p>The chrome web store link can be found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-panopto/bginlheikaacjjdajifcbakcmfcgmefh?hl=en">here</a> and the github page with a changelog is <a href="https://github.com/relliko/fast-panopto">here</a></p>
