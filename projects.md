fast-panopto is a small Chrome extension I wrote to enable users to select custom video player speeds for cases where they want to quickly go over a lecture or when the lecturer speaks slowly.
I only ever intended to use it personally but it ended up being more popular than I ever imagined with 2,500 weekly users at the time of writing this.

The chrome web store link can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-panopto/bginlheikaacjjdajifcbakcmfcgmefh?hl=en) and the github page with a changelog is [here](https://github.com/relliko/fast-panopto)
