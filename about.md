Hi. My name is Alex Polywka. My pronouns are he/him. I am a software developer with a preference for low-level development such as embedded sytems and operating systems. 
I grew up in a low-income, single-parent household and unfortunately ended up dropping out of high school due to mental health issues (I later learned this was related to undiagnosed ADHD, fun!). I moved 
to Washington state at the age of 17 and after some time spent there I decided I wanted to make a major change in the direction of my life and
completed my GED with honors in every category. With that momentum, I attended Olympic College in Bremerton, WA where I achieved a GPA over 3.8
which was enough for me to transfer into the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen school in Seattle where I completed my Bachelor of Science 
in Computer Science. After completing my degree I decided to move back to the midwest to be closer to family. Below are some cool pictures I took 
on the trip back home!
